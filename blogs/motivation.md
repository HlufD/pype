## What motivated the project

I have been a Node.js backend developer for over four years, working with various libraries like Express and frameworks like NestJS. I’ve always wanted to understand what these tools are actually doing behind the scenes.

It’s certainly possible to be productive using frameworks like Express—building production-ready applications without knowing the internal workings. However, I believe that relying solely on this “black box” approach is the wrong mental model.

Without understanding what a framework is abstracting, debugging complex issues like middleware problems or performance bottlenecks becomes much harder. I believe it is critical for a developer to understand the internals of the frameworks they use to build robust and efficient applications.
